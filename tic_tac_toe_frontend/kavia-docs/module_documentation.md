# Module-Level Documentation: tic_tac_toe_frontend

This document provides detailed, module-level documentation for the tic_tac_toe_frontend React application. Each source file is described by its purpose, public interface (where applicable), dependencies, and notable implementation details.

---

## 1. `src/index.js`

**Purpose**:  
This file serves as the entry point for the React frontend. It initializes the application by rendering the root `App` component into the DOM.

**Interface**:  
- No exported functions or components; operates by side-effect on startup.

**Dependencies**:
- React
- ReactDOM
- Local imports: `./index.css` (global styles), `./App` (root React component).

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses `ReactDOM.createRoot` (React 18+) for concurrent rendering.
- Wraps `<App />` in `<React.StrictMode>`, which activates additional runtime checks and warnings during development.
- Attaches the React app to a DOM node with the ID `root`.

---

## 2. `src/App.js`

**Purpose**:  
Implements the Tic Tac Toe board, game state management, all game logic (move handling, win/draw detection, reset), and UI rendering.

**Interface**:
- `App` (default export): The root React function component.
- Internal: `calculateWinner(squares)`—a helper function to evaluate the current board for a win condition.

**Dependencies**:
- React (uses `useState` and `useEffect` hooks)
- Local CSS: `./App.css` for the main component styles.

**Implementation Details**:
- **State Management**:  
  Maintains four states with React hooks:  
  - `board`: Array (length 9); each cell is `'X'`, `'O'`, or `null`.
  - `xIsNext`: Boolean; tracks the current player's turn.
  - `winner`: `'X'`, `'O'`, or `null` (in progress).
  - `draw`: Boolean; indicates if the game ended in a draw.

- **UI Composition**:  
  - The "App" renders a header, the tic-tac-toe board (3x3 grid of buttons), a status panel, a reset button, and a footer/credit.
  - The board is constructed using nested `.map` functions for rows/columns, where each cell is rendered as a button through `renderSquare(idx)`.
  - Buttons update the game state only if the cell is empty and the game is not over.

- **Game Logic**:
  - Moves are handled by updating the `board` array and toggling `xIsNext`.
  - Two `useEffect` calls:  
    - On mount, applies the default theme via CSS `data-theme` attribute.
    - On every board change, checks for a winner (using `calculateWinner`) and detects draws.
  - Status is displayed as "Next: X/O", "Winner: X/O", or "Draw!" depending on state.
  - The game can be reset at any time via a button, clearing all relevant state.

- **Helper Functions**:
  - `calculateWinner(squares)`: Checks all 8 win conditions (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals). Returns `'X'`, `'O'`, or `null`.
  - `renderSquare(idx)`: Renders a button for each board cell, with accessibility and state-based disabling.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Aria-labels and disabling logic ensure accessibility for screen readers and keyboard users.
  - Status and outcome are announced visually and by markup attributes.

## 3. `src/App.css`

**Purpose**:  
Defines all primary and detailed visual styling for the app, setting the color palette (soft cotton candy theme), layout, and responsive/mobile tweaks.

**Interface**:  
- Exposes no functions—styles are consumed by JSX class names.

**Dependencies**:  
- None, but is applied as a module-level import in `App.js`.

**Important Implementations**:
- Custom properties (CSS variables) define the theme, colors, and spacing.
- Styles fully configure layout for app container, tic-tac-toe grid, buttons, status display, animations, and responsive handling for phones/tablets.

---

## 4. `src/index.css`

**Purpose**:  
Provides global styles that normalize the baseline appearance of the app, including base font, background gradient, and code elements.

**Interface**:  
- Imported in `index.js` and affects the entire app.

**Dependencies**:  
- None.

**Important Implementations**:
- Sets the default font stack and body background.
- Smooth font rendering for better cross-browser readability.

---

## 5. `src/App.test.js`

**Purpose**:  
Implements a sample unit test for the `App` component using React Testing Library.

**Interface**:  
- Contains a Jest test that renders `App` and searches for a placeholder "learn react" link (based on the original template).

**Dependencies**:
- `@testing-library/react` and related ecosystem modules.
- Imports `App` for testing.

**Notable**:
- The placeholder test should be updated or replaced with tests relevant to the actual UI and game logic for production-quality assurance.

---

## 6. `src/logo.svg`

**Purpose**:  
Contains a vector SVG logo for the application (React swirling atom shape).

**Interface**:
- Used as a static asset, usually referenced in UI or documentation.

**Dependencies**:  
- None.

---

## 7. `src/setupTests.js`

**Purpose**:  
Configures React Testing Library matchers (such as `toHaveTextContent`) for all Jest tests.

**Interface**:  
- Imports `@testing-library/jest-dom` for global use in tests.
- No exports.

**Dependencies**:  
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

---

## 8. `eslint.config.mjs`

**Purpose**:  
Defines eslint configuration to enforce JavaScript/React style, including support for JSX, modern JS, and React development best practices.

**Interface**:
- Exports eslint rules and plugin configuration as a module.

**Dependencies**:  
- `@eslint/js`
- `eslint-plugin-react`

**Notable**:
- Turns off the need for explicit React import in JSX (for React 17+).
- Relaxes rules for unused variables named React or App to avoid linting errors with common design patterns.

---

## 9. `package.json`

**Purpose**:  
Specifies project metadata and dependencies, npm scripts for development, building, and testing.

**Interface**:
- Declares all module dependencies and scripts for npm/yarn.

**Dependencies**:  
- Core: `react`, `react-dom`, `react-scripts`
- Dev: `cross-env`
- Eslint configuration via `eslintConfig` field for Create React App compatibility.

---

## 10. `post_process_status.lock`

**Purpose**:  
Indicates build or post-processing status for workflows/CI (contains "SUCCESS").

**Interface**:  
- Not used at runtime or in the main application.
